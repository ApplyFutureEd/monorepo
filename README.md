## 📚 Packages

We follow monorepo software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository. The following packages are available :

    packages
    ├── admin               # NextJS frontend for admins
    ├── models              # Entities models generated by Amplify
    ├── students            # NextJS frontend for students
    ├── ui                  # Shared React components library

## 🚀 Deployment

Continous Integration and Continous Deployment process is trigger on:

-   Pull Requests opening
-   Pull Requests synchronization
-   Push on `master` branch

It will run unit tests with Jest, end-to-end tests with Cypress and static analysis with Sonarcloud.
